  <h1>Field Notes</h1>
  <p><em>What happens when you leave the ivory tower and step into the real world with a sharpened signal?</em></p>

  <p>This is where theory meets bark, heat, impulse, and sweat. Where solar panels hum while your body aches from swinging a training mace. Where you write it down because it felt true <i>in the moment</i>—not because it proved anything yet.</p>

  <p>The field is the testing ground. It's about signal over perfection, resonance over reputation. Some posts are direct; others are soft loops. All are transmissions from the edge of something alive.</p>
