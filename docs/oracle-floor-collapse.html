  <h1>The Disappearing Floor</h1>
  <p><em>There is no ladder. Only churn.</em></p>

  <p>The AI boom will bring money. Roles. Prestige.</p>
  <p>But not for the ones just arriving.</p>

  <p>Gen Z, fresh grads, the pivoting masses—</p>
  <p>They’ll find no foothold. No entry-level. No mentor to shadow.</p>

  <p>The floor is gone. The rungs are gone. Only platforms remain, high above.</p>

  <p>To join, you must already be branded, trained, augmented.</p>
  <p>Everyone else? They become the dataset. The target market. The overflow.</p>

  <p>And the systems will call that efficiency.</p>
