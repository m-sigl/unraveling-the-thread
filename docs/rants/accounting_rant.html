      <p>I got into accounting thinking it was the language of truth. A system of checks and balances. Add up the debits, match the credits, and you get reality.</p>
      
      <p>But that was before I realized how many of those checks bounce when power gets involved.</p>
      
      <p>Here’s the part they don’t tell you when you’re studying for your CPA: the numbers might be accurate, but the <em>story</em> behind them is bought and sold. Materiality isn’t an objective threshold. It’s a moving target. A weapon. A blanket to smother truth when it’s inconvenient.</p>
      
      <p>T-Mobile charges you for services they don’t deliver and calls it a billing cycle. Forward-billing and no refund? That’s not just customer abuse — that’s premature revenue recognition, underreported liabilities, and false operating cash flow. But because it’s “policy,” they get away with it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Policy, like materiality, is just another word for “we made this up and you can’t stop us.”</strong></p>
      
      <p>And the worst part? You know it. I know it. The SEC knows it. The Big Four definitely know it. But unless it threatens shareholder returns or causes a public stink, it gets swept under the rug like last quarter’s ghost assets.</p>
      
      <p>So yeah, I’m pissed. Not because the ledger is broken — but because it’s precise <em>and</em> misleading. Because I was taught this system would bring order. And all it’s done is give me a front-row seat to how the powerful tilt the table and dare us to call it level.</p>
      
      <p>Accounting <em>could</em> be sacred. But in practice, it’s a costume. A pantomime of fairness stitched together with loopholes and half-truths. And every time we shrug and say “that’s just how it works,” we become part of the lie.</p>
      
      <p>Well, fuck that. I still believe in numbers. But I believe in <strong>truth</strong> more.</p>
