    <h1>This Is Not a Contract. It's a Cage.</h1>
    <p><em>July 14, 2025</em></p>

    <p>You can’t keep calling it a “contract” when one side can change the terms whenever it wants and the other is shackled for life.</p>

    <p>I signed that master promissory note over a decade ago. I didn’t negotiate it. I didn’t have counsel. I didn’t even have a real sense of compound interest. I just had a future and a pen, and I was told this was how I built a life.</p>

    <p>Now? The terms change with every administration. Under one president, my payments are paused. Under another, they threaten to claw back interest and undo everything I’ve followed in good faith. Every time I try to get stable, someone in power moves the damn finish line.</p>

    <p>If this were any other kind of loan, it would be illegal. If this were private debt, there would be lawsuits. But because it’s the federal government, they get to play the creditor and the rulemaker. They get to rewrite the rules and still say I’m the one who failed.</p>

    <p>This is not how contracts work. This is not mutual agreement. This is power masquerading as policy.</p>

    <p>And I’m not alone. There are millions of us. We followed every instruction, hit every deadline, recertified on time, stayed in compliance—and we’re still stuck. Still being gaslit. Still being told we’re lucky we aren’t being charged more.</p>

    <p>Enough of the illusion. This isn’t a contract. It’s a cage. And calling it anything else is just another layer of the lie.</p>
