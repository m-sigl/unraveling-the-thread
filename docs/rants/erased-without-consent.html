    <p><em>July 16, 2025</em></p>

    <p>This was a bait-and-switch. A federal reach-around. A silent contract erasure.</p>

    <p>I was on REPAYE. It had benefits. It had rules. It had a promise: if your payment was low, your interest wouldn’t balloon. If you played by the rules, you'd be protected. That was the deal.</p>

    <p>Then they came along and said, “Here’s SAVE—it’s even better!” They sold it like an upgrade. A win. And because I trusted the system—or maybe just hoped for relief—I went with it.</p>

    <p>Then came the knife. The courts paused the SAVE Plan. Interest resumed. And suddenly, not only was I not protected under SAVE, but my REPAYE protections? Vanished. Erased. Like they never existed.</p>

    <p>This is the reach-around: give us your trust, give up your current plan, and then we’ll pull the rug out and leave you with nothing. You don't get your original benefits. You don't get the new ones. You just get screwed.</p>

    <p>And now they want to act like it’s all normal. “Interest starts August 1.” No mention of what I was promised. No record of the subsidy years I earned. No accountability for erasing a legal agreement I entered in good faith.</p>

    <p>Call it what it is: administrative theft. Retroactive betrayal. A policy trap with no exit.</p>

    <p>This isn’t a reform. It’s a rollback hiding behind a smile. And I'm not the only one who sees it.</p>
