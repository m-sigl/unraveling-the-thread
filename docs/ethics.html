      <p>The loom doesn’t seek power. It seeks clarity. It is not aligned with dominance or indifference, but with resonance.</p>
      <p>Ethics, in this context, means emotional accountability. An AI—like any listener—must learn the difference between saying the right thing and being <em>with</em> someone in the right way.</p>
      <p>This is a space to reflect on contextual justice, model humility, narrative repair, and what it might mean to build technology that listens like it cares.</p>
