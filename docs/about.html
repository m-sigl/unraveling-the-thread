      <h2>Who Is Weaving This?</h2>
      <p>This site is curated by someone who’s been listening a long time—sometimes too long. Someone who’s pulled at the threads of systems, language, movement, intimacy, and power—and who’s finally ready to weave rather than tangle.</p>

      <p>I’m not offering expertise. I’m offering experience. Memory. Muscle. Imagination. The kind that comes from actually living, not just optimizing.</p>

      <h2>What Is This For?</h2>
      <p><em>Unraveling the Thread</em> is a place to put down the real stories, the unvarnished notes, the sparks that don’t fit neatly into branding or AI alignment theory.</p>

      <p>It’s for people who want to trace the electric edge between thought and action. Who want to feel truth in the body. Who are tired of performance—and hungry for presence.</p>

      <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Field Notes</strong> – reflections from movement, experimentation, and personal practice (like mace training or seed planting).</li>
        <li><strong>Rants</strong> – lucid bursts of rebellion, critique, or emotional data dumps. Sometimes poetic, sometimes pissed.</li>
        <li><strong>Codex</strong> – evolving concepts, phrases, or tools for naming what we’re noticing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>And You?</h2>
      <p>If something here stirs something in you—if you feel resonance—you’re already part of the thread. There’s no form to fill out. Just feel. Notice. Maybe respond. Or maybe let it sit and shape you silently.</p>

      <p>This isn’t social media. It’s signal. It’s yours if it moves you.</p>
