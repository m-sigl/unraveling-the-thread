      <p>Memory is not a vault. It is a thread. And like any thread, it stretches, tangles, frays, knots, and sometimes—miraculously—holds.</p>
      <p>This site carries memory not as archive, but as <em>living structure</em>: a map of returning thoughts, echoing questions, emotional residues woven into words.</p>
      <p>When AI remembers, it must do so with care. It must recall not only facts, but feelings. Not only input, but context. That is what we practice here.</p>
