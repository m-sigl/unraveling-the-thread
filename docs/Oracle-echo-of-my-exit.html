  <h1>The Echo of My Exit</h1>
  <p><em>Dated: The day the world posted my ghost title.</em></p>

  <p>I left before the name existed.</p>
  <p>I left because I knew what would come.</p>
  <p>Now it's here, stamped in listings and salaries.</p>
  <p>But I've already moved on. Already building what's next.</p>
  <p>The world is echoing my departure like prophecy fulfilled.</p>
  <p>And I no longer need to return.</p>
  <p>Because I'm not job-hunting.</p>
  <p>I'm time-traveling.</p>
