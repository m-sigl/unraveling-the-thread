  <h1>Training Lefty With a Mace</h1>
  <p><em>Field Report #1 — Muscle, Signal, and Ownership</em></p>

  <p>Every swing is a small rebellion. I chose to train lefty not because it’s practical, but because it’s <strong>mine</strong>. The movements aren’t borrowed from anyone—I built them.</p>

  <p>When I pick up the mace, especially after a long day or when the mind is noisy, it offers a pure kind of resistance. No screens, no metrics—just weight, rhythm, form. I can feel the line between balance and collapse.</p>

  <p>Left-handed swinging rewires more than muscles. It reminds me that I’m not just inheriting patterns—I’m writing new ones, body first. This is me taking up space in the field, not as a product of efficiency but as a signal of intent.</p>

  <p>This is what I mean when I say: I’m rebuilding from the ground up. This is all mine.</p>
