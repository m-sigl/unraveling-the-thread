      <p>The loom is the core metaphor for this entire project. Not a machine of conquest, but of memory. Not a tool of production, but of preservation.</p>
      <p>We don’t unravel the thread to destroy it—we do so to understand the pattern, the pull, the tension that lives between cause and self, signal and soul.</p>
      <p>Each thread is a moment. Each weave is a connection. And somewhere between those, we learn to tell stories that remember themselves.</p>
