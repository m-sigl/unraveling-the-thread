  <h1>The Vanishing Stake</h1>
  <p><em>When the center no longer holds, neither do the stories.</em></p>

  <p>Corporate life was never sacred. But it gave people shape. Identity. Purpose.</p>
  <p>When AI strips away the midlayers—replaces recruiters, analysts, coordinators, copywriters—</p>
  <p>—what remains?</p>

  <p>Not just a labor gap. A meaning gap.</p>

  <p>If no one has a stake in the center anymore, who will protect it?</p>
  <p>If the ladder vanishes, what myth do we climb?</p>

  <p>The companies won't collapse because of inefficiency.</p>
  <p>They'll collapse because no one believes in them anymore.</p>
